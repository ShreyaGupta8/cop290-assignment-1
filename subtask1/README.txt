To compile the code, use make.
Command line ./output

Enter the name of the image you want to correct and crop without .jpg extension if the images are in same folder as the code, else enter the complete path without .jpg extension. Then press enter.

To use the code for more images at a time, again run using ./output and type in the name of next image file when prompted.
 
Both the output images for each empty.jpg and traffic.jpg image files will also be stored in the same folder as the code and the input images when the code is run for both files.
